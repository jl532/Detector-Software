# BME547Final

you'll need to download mongo db community edition to run the server locally, but otherwise this should work

set up your virtual environment and then try using 
pip install -r freshRequirements.txt to populate it with all the packages i think you'll need

you'll probably run into some random errors because i've been floating between running locally and on my VM
post them and i can tell you where to fix your code
